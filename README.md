# [p01]Calvin's leaf collect

Idk if anyone will read this but if you are reading it then:
Hello. This is my retro web adventure project for CINS 110! 
The adventure takes place in an ordinary home with an ordinary pet hamster whose name is Calvin.
You play as Calvin for the enitirety of the game and go on a variety adventures, and ultimately
it seems like I've made the goal for you to get that girl (hamster) "Lulu" because what's the fun of an adventure
if you don't get the girl in the end lol ',:)


THANKS FOR PLAYING.
